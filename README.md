# Requirements
Node-Red v19.4 or greater
Node-Red-dashboard v2.13.0 or greater
# Configuration and behavior
Widget has 3 different layouts: Single Horizontal, Pair Horizontal and Single Vertical.

Takes the `msg.payload` and displays the value at the top of the level graphics.
For Pair Horizontal layout the `msg.payload` is expected to be an `array`
`msg.payload` is validated to find a nummeric value. So you can send number `msg.payload = 15` or string `msg.payload = "15"` 

The node's `Label` is displayed near the value. Leave the label field empty to show value only.
For Pair Horizontal layout the `Label` is not displayed but both `Channels` can be labelled independently.

All four colors for stripes can be customized. In adition there is three options to show the colors. `Multiple segments` - Colors tied to stripes according to sector values. `Single color bar` - Single value based color for all active stripes or `Interpolated colors`.

The node's `Unit` will be displayed near the current value. Exact position of the unit depends on choosed layout. The unit can be any `string`, for example: `lbs psi FÂ°` Set the unit to empty string if you don't need to display it.

The min and max values are customizable within the configuration or you can change them on fly by sending new values with `msg.ui_control` property.

The segments's values are also customizable within the configuration and with `msg.ui_control`

You can choose anmations to be `soft` or `reactive` or animations can be turned `off` completely.

You can choose between 3 different stripe resolutions. `Superfine`, `Fine` and `Normal`


## Examples of `msg.ui_control` usage

`msg.ui_control = {min:10, max:80}` _to change min and max values._

`msg.ui_control = {min:10, max:80, seg1:30, seg2:60}` _to change min, max and segments all together._

`msg.ui_control = {seg2:60}` _to change high segement value only._

## Performance alert

This widget is not perfect choice to display high-frequent data changes like audio or similar.  
If you are using a lot of Level widgets on your dashboard and you are feeling performance loss, considere lower resolution for stripes and/or turning off the animations.
